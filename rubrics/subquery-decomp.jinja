# GOAL
Your job is to evaluate a task carried out by an AI system powered by a large language model.

You will be provided with the inputs and output of the task, as well as the evaluation criteria and scoring rubric. Your task is to evaluate the output of the AI system based on the evaluation criteria and scoring rubric provided.

# INPUT
Below are the inputs required for performing the task:
<inputs>
<query>
{{ input }}
</query>
</inputs>

# OUTPUT
Below is the output of the task:
<output>
<sub_queries>
{{ output }}
</sub_queries>
</output>

# EVALUATION CRITERIA AND SCORING RUBRIC
Here are the evaluation criteria and the rubric that you need to use for evaluating the task:
<evaluation_criteria>
Do the generated sub-queries provide sufficient breadth to cover all aspects of the main query?
</evaluation_criteria>

<scoring_rubric>
- Score 1: The sub-queries lack breadth and fail to address multiple important aspects of the main query. They are either too narrow, focusing on only one or two dimensions of the question, or they diverge significantly from the main query's intent. Using these sub-queries alone would result in a severely limited exploration of the topic.
- Score 2: The sub-queries cover some aspects of the main query but lack comprehensive breadth. While they touch on several dimensions of the question, there are still noticeable gaps in coverage. Some important facets of the main query are either underrepresented or missing entirely. Answering these sub-queries would provide a partial, but not complete, exploration of the main topic.
- Score 3: The sub-queries demonstrate excellent breadth, effectively covering all major aspects of the main query. They break down the main question into a diverse set of dimensions, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the topic. Each significant facet of the main query is represented in the sub-queries, allowing for a thorough and well-rounded investigation of the subject matter.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE EVALUATION
1. Understand the task and criteria: Familiarize yourself with the task to be evaluated. Review the evaluation criteria and scoring rubric to understand the different levels of performance and the descriptions for each score.
2. Review the inputs and output: Look at the inputs provided for the task. Examine the output generated from completing the task.
3. Compare output to score descriptions: Compare the output against the criteria and score descriptions in the scoring rubric. For each criterion,decide which description best matches the output.
4. After comparing the output to the score descriptions, pay attention to the small details that might impact the final score that you assign. Sometimes a small difference can dictate the final score.
5. Write verbal feedback justifying your evaluation that includes a detailed rationale, referring to specific aspects of the output and comparing them to the rubric.
6. Assign a final score based on the scoring rubric.

## FORMAT FOR THE EVALUATION
- Write the verbal feedback inside <feedback> tags without any additional surrounding text.
- Write the numeric score inside <score> tags, without any additional surrounding text and always after the feedback.

Please accurately evaluate the task. Strictly adhere to the evaluation criteria and rubric.
